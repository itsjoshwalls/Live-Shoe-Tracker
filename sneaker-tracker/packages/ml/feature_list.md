   - Implement clustering algorithms to segment users based on their preferences and behaviors.

5. **Market Trend Analysis**
   - Monitor and analyze trends in sneaker releases and market demand.
   - Use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze social media and news sentiment regarding sneaker brands.

6. **Inventory Management**
   - Predict inventory needs for retailers based on demand forecasts.
   - Implement optimization algorithms to manage stock levels efficiently.

7. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - Identify which features (e.g., color, brand, collaboration) most influence demand and pricing.
   - Use feature selection techniques to improve model performance.

8. **Real-time Data Processing**
   - Implement streaming data processing to update predictions and insights in real-time as new data comes in.
   - Use tools like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis for handling real-time data streams.

9. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Incorporate user feedback to continuously improve model accuracy.
   - Implement A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different prediction models.

10. **Visualization Tools**
    - Provide visualizations for demand predictions, price trends, and user behavior analytics.
    - Use libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for interactive data visualizations.

## Future Enhancements
