The warm, softly textured copper surface contrasts elegantly with the cool polish of stainless steel cases, breathing fresh life into the timeless aesthetics of the line. Conceived as the quintessential dress watch for modern aesthetes, the Master Ultra Thin series continues to embody understated sophistication, rooted in the Maison’s legacy of ultra-thin watchmaking that dates back to the early 1900s.The new copper dials bring a distinctive character to these models, shifting in tone as light plays across their surface — from powdery softness to richer saturation. Symmetry and balance define the dial layouts, anchored by either a date display or a moon phase aperture at six o’clock. Elongated trapezoid indexes echo the sharp geometry of Dauphine hands, which alternate between satin-brushed and polished facets to create subtle visual intrigue. Completing the refined aesthetic, both watches are paired with interchangeable brown alligator straps and stainless-steel folding clasps, offering versatility alongside elegance.While united by the Master Ultra Thin’s signature design language, each reference highlights its complication with unique detailing. The Master Ultra Thin Date features a crisp white date disc framed by copper tones, powered by the in-house Calibre 899 with a 70-hour reserve. The Master Ultra Thin Moon showcases a silver moon against a deep blue starry sky, encircled by date numerals, driven by Calibre 925. Both movements are visible through sapphire case-backs, revealing fine finishes such as Côtes de Genève, bevelled bridges, and an open-worked pink gold rotor. Limited to 800 pieces each, these watches undergo the Maison's rigorous 1,000 Hour Control testing, ensuring precision and reliability while reaffirming the Maison’s commitment to technical excellence and timeless design.

(The race is taking place in Nevada, US, from November 21-23 as part of the Formula One World Championships.)The design itself is wholly inspired by the city of lights. It captures the energy, skyline, architecture and signage of Vegas through a 'Sketch in Motion' line technique. Creating a predominantly monochromatic color palette, MSO's bespoke \"Muriwai White\" paint decorates the vehicle with sleek Muriwai House and Vegas Nights motifs. The lines are set against a deep \"Black\" finish with subtle flecks of \"Cyan\", \"Magenta\" and \"Green\", designed to capture the vibrant glow of Las Vegas at night – creating a museum worthy aesthetic finish that is steeped in storytelling and nods directly to the energy of the Grand Prix.Adding a personal touch, McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri also had input on the design. The pair added the team's tenth Constructors' World Championship star on the rear bumper, celebrating its recent win, alongside signature lines and individual sketches.Project Viva will be on display at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas from November 13-20Scroll up to see the final design.</div><p><a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2025/11/mclaren-unveils-bespoke-vegas-inspired-750s-ahead-of-las-vegas-grand-prix\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"McLaren Unveils Bespoke Vegas Inspired 750S ahead of Las Vegas Grand Prix\">Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast</a></p>",

This collaboration has resulted in a unique custom-made Air Force 1 created exclusively for him.Oli was diagnosed with cancer in kindergarten and endures long hospital stays and chemotherapy. To help cope with the overwhelming treatment, he established a tradition of celebrating the end of each session with his preferred Chipotle meal. This personal ritual served as the inspiration for the Chipotle x Nike Air Force 1.The design of the silhouette is rich with details referencing Chipotle. The metallic silver overlays are inspired by the bottom of Chipotle's burrito bowl packaging, while the green Swooshes represent guacamole. Chipotle logos are prominently featured on the outer tongue and heel. The sock liner borrows the print from Chipotle's brown to-go bags, and Oli's exact food order is printed on the inner tongue. A standout detail is the text \"Oli’s Order #572\" on the heel tab, which commemorates the 572 laps that Oli walked around the oncology inpatient unit at Doernbecher during his treatment. Finally, the phrase \"Chipotle Is My Life\" is embossed on the brown rubber outsole, which mirrors the colors of Chipotle's napkins and to-go bags.The thoughtfulness of the collaboration extends to the packaging with a custom Chipotle burrito bowl and Chipotle's classic utensils with a Nike-inspired twist.While this Chipotle x Nike Air Force 1 will not be available to the public, Oli's original Doernbecher x Air Force 1 design will be released later this winter as part of Nike’s Doernbecher Freestyle 21 collection.</div><p><a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2025/11/chipotle-and-nike-craft-an-exclusive-air-force-1-for-the-doernbecher-freestyle-programm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chipotle and Nike Craft an Exclusive Air Force 1 for the Doernbecher Freestyle Programm\">Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast</a></p>",

Haring, whose art is celebrated for its accessibility and bold Pop Art sensibility, originally created a carousel for the visionary Luna Luna amusement park in Hamburg nearly four decades ago. That project transformed his signature two-dimensional line drawings into dynamic sculptural forms, animating seats and panels with playful figures that embodied both irony and poetryFollowing the reopening of Luna Luna at The Shed in New York, Gufram has reimagined two of Haring’s carousel seats — the Dog and the Crawling Baby — as collectible design objects. Crafted in soft polyurethane and finished with Gufram’s proprietary Guflac® coating, the pieces translate Haring’s carnival-inspired imagery into domestic settings.This release continues Gufram’s tradition of bridging art and functionality through collaborations with leading creatives. From partnerships with the Andy Warhol Foundation to projects with Snarkitecture and TOILETPAPER, the brand has consistently challenged design conventions with irony, provocation, and imagination. By merging the artist’s playful motifs with Gufram’s radical approach to material innovation, the collection turns the concept of amusement into functional design, offering a fresh way to experience Haring’s visual language.For more details, head over to Gufram’s official website.</div><p><a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2025/11/gufram-luna-luna-keith-haring-dog-crawling-baby-design-objects-info\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gufram Revives Keith Haring’s Luna Luna Carousel Seats\">Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast</a></p>",

The cinematic battlefield will see the biggest franchises, the most ambitious auteurs and the most talented A-listers clash for your time, attention and box office dollars. From long-awaited superhero showdowns to prestige epics and the return of cult favorites, next year's slate is absolutely stacked. We've cut through the noise, ignored the speculative whispers, and curated the 10 films that are a must-watch in 2026.The Mummy Release date: April 17, 2026The mere prospect of Blumhouse and New Line breathing new life into The Mummy franchise has created a stir powerful enough to send tremors through ancient Egyptian tombs — and perhaps even rouse Imhotep himself. Although details are scarce, The Mummy 4 is rumored to bring back original franchise stars Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, also known as Radio Silence, are set to direct, and the new installment will supposedly ignore the events of the third film released in 2008.MichaelRelease date: April 24, 2026Biopics can be tricky, but director Antoine Fuqua's retelling of Michael Jackson's career is looking pretty promising. Michael sees the King of Pop's real nephew Jaafar Jackson step into his uncle's Florsheim penny loafers, and will follow the story of Jackson's beginnings with the Jackson 5 and his journey to global superstardom. The teaser trailer offers a quick look at what fans can expect, and even shares a glimpse at Kendrick Sampson as the late Quincy Jones. Viewers were quick to praise Jaafar Jackson's resemblance and embodiment of Michael, with many hoping the biopic will stray from the genre's formulaic nature.The Devil Wears Prada 2Release date: May 1, 2026Alright everyone, gird your loins! Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are all coming back for The Devil Wears Prada 2. Helmed by original director David Frankel, the upcoming sequel will see Miranda Priestly (Streep) go head-to-head with former assistant Emily (Blunt), who now works as a top executive. In the midst of Miranda's impending retirement and the decline of print, she battles with Emily for those important advertising dollars. The first teaser for The Devil Wears Prada 2 promises the same levels of high fashion, glamor and drama that made the first film a cult favorite.The Mandalorian and GroguRelease date: May 22, 2026Pedro Pascal is putting Din Djarin's helmet back on for The Mandalorian and Grogu, a Lucasfilm that serves as a continuation of The Mandalorian series on Disney+. The film takes place after the fall of the Galactic Empire (around five years after Episode VI – Return of the Jedi), with Mando and Grogu joining the New Republic. Joining Pascal in the cast are Sigourney Weaver as Ward, a colonel and leader of the New Republic and Jeremy Allen White as Rotta the Hutt, son of Jabba. Turns out a fourth season wasn't the way for Jon Favreau.Untitled Steven Spielberg UFO ProjectRelease date: June 12, 2026Steven Spielberg and UFOs? Count us in. Details for this still-untitled sci-fi project are minimal, but a cast made up of Emily Blunt, Josh O'Conner, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo and Wyatt Russell is enough to get us seated. David Koepp wrote the screenplay based off a story from Spielberg himself, and footage that was previously previewed hinted at action-packed sequences.Supergirl&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by James Gunn (@jamesgunn)Release date: June 26, 2026James Gunn is building on the success of 2025's Superman (starring David Corenswet in the titular role) with 2026's Supergirl. The film will source its material from Tom King and Bilquis Evely's comic book miniseries Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, and will see Milly Alcock reprise her role as Kara Zor-El/Supergirl from Superman. The self-titled DCU film will follow Supergirl as she travels across the galaxy on her 21st birthday, where she meets a young girl and experiences a situation that puts her on a path of revenge.The OdysseyRelease date: July 17, 2026We would be amiss if we didn't include Christopher Nolan's adaptation of Homer's ancient Greek epic, The Odyssey. Adding to the filmmaker's hype is a stellar cast: think Matt Damon, Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Elliot Page, Mia Goth and more gracing the same screen. The director, fresh off his Oppenheimer triumph, is shooting this film entirely on IMAX's 70mm film cameras to capture the mythic scale of Odysseus's perilous ten-year journey home after the Trojan War. With promises of sweeping real-world locations and a budget to match the legendary scope, the film is already being hailed as the next major cinematic event, blending classical literature with the uncompromising realism that defines a Nolan epic.Spider-Man: Brand New DayRelease date: July 31, 2026Just a few weeks after The Odyssey, Tom Holland and Zendaya will return to our screens as young Peter Parker and MJ in Spider-Man: Brand New Day. The fourth film in the MCU Spider-Man series picks up where No Way Home left off — leaving a lonely Peter who loses his girlfriend and friends in order to keep his superhero identity a secret. Also reprising their roles the MCU are Jacob Batalon as Ned, Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle/Punisher, Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Michael Mando as Mac Gargan/Scorpio. Meanwhile, Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas are set to join the cast.Dune: Part Three&nbsp;View this post on Instagram&nbsp;A post shared by DUNE (@dunemovie)Release date: December 18, 2026Denis Villeneuve is closing out his Dune adaptation with the release of Part Three. The trilogy closer will adapt Frank Herbert's Dune Messiah, which takes place 12 years after Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) began ruling as Emperor. Still guided by his visions, Paul faces political conspiracies, as well as fertility issues with his wife Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and Fremen concubine Chani (Zendaya). Seeing as how captivating Part One and Part Two both were, many are optimistic about the space opera epic finale.Avengers: DoomsdayRelease date: December 18, 2026December 18 will mark a double Florence Pugh feature with Avengers: Doomsday premiering on the same as Dune: Part Three. The audience's return to the Avengers series will mark their first since 2019's beloved Endgame, and will feature a slew of old and new MCU faces: Chris Hemsworth, Vanessa Kirby, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Letitia Wright, Paul Rudd, Wyatt Russell, Tenoch Huerta Mejía, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Simu Liu, Florence Pugh, Kelsey Grammer, Lewis Pullman, Danny Ramirez, Joseph Quinn, David Harbour, Winston Duke, Hannah John-Kamen, Tom Hiddleston, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal and, of course, Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom. In Doomsday, the Avengers, Wakandans, X-Men and Fantastic Four must team up to take down the powerful Doctor Doom and once again save humanity.</div><p><a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2025/11/10-most-hyped-movies-films-2026-avengers-doomsday-the-odyssey-spider-man-brand-new-day-the-odyssey\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The 10 Most Hyped Films of 2026\">Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast</a></p>",

Rather than relying on incremental updates, the label uses each season as a building block to redefine its aesthetic language, ensuring that its forward momentum remains both intentional and innovative.For Autumn/Winter 2025, inspiration stems from the beauty found in everyday routines and mundane tasks — moments of clarity that arise when the mind is free from distraction. This theme translates into garments and accessories that balance comfort and convenience with elevated design.Performance gym wear merges with office attire, while coats are styled over pyjamas, reflecting a playful yet practical approach to dressing. Intentional creasing, casual silhouettes reimagined with sophistication, and modular bags with removable sections highlight the collection’s embrace of “beautifully chaotic” style. Everyday motifs, such as keys reinterpreted as zipper pulls and embroideries, further anchor the designs in urban life.Sustainability remains central to ARCS’ ethos, with the brand continuing to collaborate with specialist textile mills at the forefront of innovation. A standout material this season is the HEX fabric, developed by a Taiwanese mill, which combines recycled ripstop with a reflective 3M thread. This technical fabric lends durability and a distinctive edge to several bag styles.Expanding its accessories offering, ARCS introduces its first holdall and two new messenger bags, each featuring modular elements like removable flaps that transform into smaller crossbody bags. Hardware updates, including beaded and key-shaped zipper pulls and black powder-coated buckles, reinforce the collection’s attention to detail.The apparel range also grows significantly, welcoming ARCS’ first woollen coat, the RYE jacket, alongside the continued expansion of its Made in Italy knitwear line. Denim pieces feature bespoke washes that mimic natural creasing, while tailoring is explored through new silhouettes such as the HOME trousers with engineered seams and invisible pockets, the asymmetrical CLEO vest and long-line SWEETNESS skirt. Modern suiting is redefined with the LEGACY jacket and FLIP skirt, offering fresh interpretations of classic forms.Check out the lookbook in the gallery above. ARCS' FW25 collection is now avaialable to shop through the brand's webstore.</div><p><a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2025/11/arcs-fall-winter-2025-collection-lookbook-info\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ARCS FW25 Finds Beauty in Everyday Routines\">Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast</a></p>",

This distinctive silhouette, originally designed for post-performance recovery, is set to return in Spring 2026, offering modern comfort wrapped in its signature futuristic cage design.The Rejuven8 is instantly recognizable by its breathable inner bootie encased within a unique, perforated TPU cage. This construction was lauded for its lightweight feel and exceptional ventilation. The shoe’s return will focus on two contrasting colorways that cater to different aesthetics.The \"Black/Sail\" iteration provides a minimalist, lifestyle-focused look, utilizing a clean black upper contrasted sharply by a classic Sail-toned midsole. This muted take highlights the complex structure without the flash, making it highly versatile.In stark contrast, the “Metallic Silver/Voltage Green-Black” option leans heavily into its Y2K technical heritage. The silver shell and black accents are explosively brightened by the Voltage Green hits, reviving the aggressive, eye-catching color blocking that defined its original release.The Air Rejuven8 evokes nostalgia and offers extreme comfort and a design that remains ahead of its time. Prepare for this unique piece of Nike innovation to land on shelves in Spring 2026.</div><p><a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2025/11/nike-air-rejuven8-returns-in-2026-black-sail-if5958-002-metallic-silver-voltage-green-black-if5958-003-release-info\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nike Air Rejuven8 Returns in Spring 2026\">Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast</a></p>",

This shoe takes the aggressive, track-inspired DNA of the original and propels it forward with a futuristic, streamlined design.The Air Max Plus VII is immediately recognizable for its intense color application. The \"University Red\" hue dominates the silhouette, drenching the entire neoprene upper, molded TPU overlays, and structural cages in the fiery shade. Subtle black accents are strategically used on the outsole and the signature \"TN\" branding on the heel, providing a necessary contrast that makes the red pop even brighter.This model upgrades the familiar Air Max Plus aesthetic with a more sculpted midsole and a sleeker collar cut. The shoe still relies on its defining feature: the tuned Air units visible in the heel and forefoot, which promise the responsive, lightweight cushioning that has made the franchise a staple of comfort and performance since the late 90s. The updated lacing system further ensures a secure, personalized fit.</div><p><a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2025/11/nike-air-max-plus-vii-university-red-hq2197-600-release-info\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Official Look at the Nike Air Max Plus VII &quot;University Red&quot;\">Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast</a></p>",
